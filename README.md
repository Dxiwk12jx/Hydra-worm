# Hydra-worm
Hydra-Worm is a rogue self-replicating exploit that tears through networks like a digital virus with a mind of its own. Kill one process, two more spawn. It mutates its code, dodges detection, opens hidden backdoors, and spreads laterally across systems. Built to persist, adapt, and dominate the grid.
